* **Backend Developer**: Builds API endpoints, database schemas, and core logic.
* **Database Administrator**: Designs and optimizes the database for performance.
* **DevOps Engineer**: Manages deployment, monitoring, and scaling.
* **QA Engineer**: Tests backend features for quality and reliability.


## ⚙️ Technology Stack

* **Django**: High-level Python web framework for building RESTful APIs.
* **Django REST Framework**: Tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
* **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured data storage.
* **GraphQL**: Flexible data querying across multiple resources.
* **Celery**: Asynchronous task queue for background jobs.
* **Redis**: Caching and session management.
* **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment.
* **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.


## 🏗️ Database Design

### Entities & Key Fields

* **User**

  * user\_id, first\_name, last\_name, email, password\_hash, role, created\_at
* **Property**

  * property\_id, host\_id, name, description, location, price\_per\_night, created\_at
* **Booking**

  * booking\_id, property\_id, user\_id, start\_date, end\_date, total\_price, status, created\_at
* **Payment**

  * payment\_id, booking\_id, amount, payment\_date, payment\_method
* **Review**

  * review\_id, property\_id, user\_id, rating, comment, created\_at
* **Message**

  * message\_id, sender\_id, recipient\_id, message\_body, sent\_at

### Relationships

* A user can have multiple properties.
* A property can have multiple bookings.
* A booking is linked to one property and one user.
* A payment is linked to one booking.
* Reviews are tied to specific properties and bookings.
